# ITA-API

IT Academy exercice that focuses on a basic introduction to Typescript and REST APIs.

This site calls joke APIs on loadup and on request. You can also rate the current joke, rating will be stored locally until page closes. The site also calls to a weather API, displaying current weather and temperature in Barcelona.

The project simply uses Typescript, with scripts already compiled to JS. To try out the project, simply clone this repo and open `index.html` locally, or go [here](https://readek.github.io/ITA-API/) to try it out now.
